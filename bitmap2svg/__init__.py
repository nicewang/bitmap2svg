    Converts a PIL Image object to an SVG string using the C++ backend.

    The C++ backend handles color quantization (including adaptive color count
    if num_colors is None or <=0), contour detection, polygon simplification,
    and SVG generation.

    Args:
        image: The input PIL.Image.Image object.
        num_colors: The desired number of dominant colors in the SVG.
                    If None or <=0, the C++ backend will adaptively choose
                    the number of colors.
        resize: If True, the image will be resized to `target_size` before
                conversion. This can significantly affect processing time and
                output complexity.
        target_size: A tuple (width, height) for resizing if `resize` is True.
        simplification_epsilon_factor: Controls polygon simplification.
                                       Higher values mean more simplification and
                                       fewer points in polygons. Corresponds to
                                       the epsilon factor used in Douglas-Peucker.
                                       Default: 0.009.
        min_contour_area: The minimum area (in pixels^2 of the processed image)
                          for a detected contour to be included in the SVG.
                          Helps filter out noise or very small details.
                          Default: 10.0.
        max_features_to_render: The maximum number of distinct colored polygons
                                (features) to render in the SVG. If 0, all
                                features passing other filters will be rendered.
                                Features are typically sorted by area descending,
                                so this effectively renders the largest N features.
                                Default: 0 (unlimited).

    Returns:
        A string containing the SVG code.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input image is not a PIL.Image.Image instance.
        ValueError: If target_size is not valid.
        ImportError: If the C++ core module cannot be imported.
        RuntimeError: If an error occurs during C++ processing.
